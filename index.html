  <h1>Recipes for Asian Cuisine</h1>
  <h3>Backstory</h3>
  <p>Growing up in an asian household, I have always eaten asian cuisine almost <em>every single day</em>. Does that mean I prefer eating
  asian cuisines over other choices? <strong>No.</strong> </p>
  <p><em>You might be asking, why did you choose Asian then?</em></p>
  <p>My parents and grandparents are not gonna be immortal, and I would have
  to start making some Chinese foods soon. I have to start preparing how to make asian food
  for my children and for the rest of my bloodline. </p>

  <h2>Asian Cuisine Recipes</h2>
  <h4>Background Information</h4>
  <p>My mom's side of family is from Jilin (吉林), China. I have eaten a lot of cuisines from here repetitively because I grew up with my grandparents. Therefore, there are
    not many things that I particularly like. However, I am extremely thankful for my grandma who makes the best food
    for me no matter what culture it is from. In Jilin, most of the land is agriculture,
    meaning that most of the cuisines made are from some type of produce like lettuce!


  <p>One food that I eat a lot is</p>
  <ul>
      <li><a href = '/asian-recipes/pages/dumplings.html'>Dumplings</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Background Information</h4>
  <p>My dad's side is from Fuzhou (福州), China. Other than my grandma who cooks around the house,
  my dad also makes food. He changes up the taste every so often, matching it to his hometown.
  Due to the fact that Fuzhou is near a body of water, seafood is extremely popular around here.
  Therefore, there are a lot of cuisines that have a lot of seafood incorporated in it.
  One food that is made often by dad is
  <ul>
    <li><a href = '/asian-recipes/pages/wonton.html'>Fuzhou Wonton</a></li>
  </ul>
